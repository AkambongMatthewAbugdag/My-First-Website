          <p> I am <strong>Akambong Matthew Abugdag</strong>, a <em>Software Engineer in the making who is involved in Web Development, Civil Engineering, Hackathons, C Programming, being a Virtual Assistant</em> to emerging companies and doing a whole lot of stuff.
            I am a multidimensional and versatile human capable of fdoing a lot of things whicjh makes it difficult for me to focus on just one thing at a time. That sometimes becomes my flaw and I get sick and tired of making mistakes and not being organized.
